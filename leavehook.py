## What is this leave invoke ?
##
## Leave is not supposed to panic, it's a way to tell parent function that
## there is an error occur with it, and all jobs and resources must immidiately 
## be freed. The leave will combine with the cleanup stack and trap handler,
## create a powerful exception handling with stack and heap object.
##
## Because of that, we don't know what the code of the leave resulted, only
## the parent function know it. This is a hook to get the leave code, for debugging
## and reversing an app/game or a mechanism.
##
## Hook this with every processes (UID 0)
